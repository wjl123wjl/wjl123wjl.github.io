I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) under the supervision of Professor [Chao Zhang](https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/people/chaoz) and [Zongpeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnsBY_AAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received a B.E. from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) (HUST) in 2019 (with the highest honor). 
My primary research interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, I focus on the following areas:

1. AI security in the computer vision domain, such as adversarial, backdoor, and bit-flip attacks.
2. AI security in other domains (such as learning-based malware detectors, and binary similarity detection models).
3. AI interpretability.
